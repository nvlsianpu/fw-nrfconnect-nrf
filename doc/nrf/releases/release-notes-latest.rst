.. note::
    This file is a work in progress and might not cover all relevant changes.

Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

nRF5
====

The following changes are relevant for the nRF52 and nRF53 Series.

nRF5340 SoC
-----------

* Updated:

  * ``bl_boot`` library - Disabled clock interrupts before booting the application.
    This change fixes an issue where the :ref:`bootloader` sample would not be able to boot a Zephyr application on the nRF5340 SoC.

Thread
------

* Added:

  * Development support for the nRF5340 in single-protocol configuration for the :ref:`ot_cli_sample`, :ref:`coap_client_sample`, and :ref:`coap_server_sample` samples.

* Optimized ROM and RAM used by Thread samples.

Common
======

The following changes are relevant for all device families.

Crypto
------

* Added:

  * nrf_cc3xx_platform v0.9.5, with the following highlights:

    * Added correct TRNG characterization values for nRF5340 devices.

    See the :ref:`crypto_changelog_nrf_cc3xx_platform` for detailed information.
  * nrf_cc3xx_mbedcrypto version v0.9.5, with the following highlights:

    * Built to match the nrf_cc3xx_platform v0.9.5 including correct TRNG characterization values for nRF5340 devices.

    See the :ref:`crypto_changelog_nrf_cc3xx_mbedcrypto` for detailed information.

* Updated:

  * Rewrote the :ref:`nrfxlib:nrf_security`'s library stripping mechanism to not use the POST_BUILD option in a custom build rule.
    The library stripping mechanism was non-functional in certain versions of SEGGER Embedded Studio Nordic Edition.

MCUboot
=======

sdk-mcuboot
-----------

The MCUboot fork in |NCS| contains all commits from the upstream MCUboot repository up to and including ``c74c551ed6``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.
The list of the most important recent changes can be found in :ref:`ncs_release_notes_140`.

* bootloader

  * Added hardening against hardware level fault injection and timing attacks,
    see ``CONFIG_BOOT_FIH_PROFILE_HIGH`` and similar kconfig options.
  * Introduced Abstract crypto primitives to simplify porting.
  * Added ram-load upgrade mode (not enabled for zephy-rtos yet).
  * Renamed single-image mode to single-slot mode,
    see ``CONFIG_SINGLE_APPLICATION_SLOT``.
  * Added patch for turning off cache for Cortex M7 before chain-loading.
  * Fixed issue causing that HW stack protection catches the chain-loaded
    application during its early initialization.
  * Added reset of Cortex SPLIM registers before boot.
  * Fixesd build issue that occurs if CONF_FILE contains multiple file paths
    instead of single file path.
  * Added watchdog feed on nRF devices. See ``CONFIG_BOOT_WATCHDOG_FEED`` option.
  * Removed the flash_area_read_is_empty() port implementation function.
  * Initialize the ARM core configuration only when selected by the user,
    see ``CONFIG_MCUBOOT_CLEANUP_ARM_CORE``.
  * Allow the final data chunk in the image to be unaligned in
    the serial-recovery protocol.

* imgtool

  * Print image digest during verify.
  * Add possibility to set confirm flag for hex files as well.
  * Usage of --confirm implies --pad.
  * Fixed 'custom_tlvs' argument handling.

The Zephyr fork in |NCS| contains all commits from the upstream Zephyr repository up to and including ``7a3b253ced``, plus some |NCS| specific additions.

For a complete list of upstream Zephyr commits incorporated into |NCS| since the most recent release, run the following command from the :file:`ncs/zephyr` repository (after running ``west update``):

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline 7a3b253ced ^v2.3.0-rc1-ncs1

For a complete list of |NCS| specific commits, run:

.. code-block:: none

   git log --oneline manifest-rev ^7a3b253ced

The current |NCS| release is based on Zephyr 2.4.0.
See the :ref:`Zephyr 2.4.0 release notes <zephyr:zephyr_2.4>` for a list of changes.

For the list of the most recent additions specific to |NCS|, see :ref:`ncs_release_notes_140`.

* Drivers and Sensors

  * Flash

    * Add support for nRF53 Series SoCs in  nRF QSPI NOR flash driver (nrf_qspi_nor).

  * USB

    * Made USB DFU class compatible with the target configuration that does not
      have a secondary image slot.
    * Support to use USB DFU within MCUBoot with single application slot mode.


* Libraries / Subsystems

  * Settings

    * Removed SETTINGS_USE_BASE64 support as its been deprecated for more than two releases.

  * Storage

    * flash_map: Added API to get the value of an erased byte in the flash_area, see ``flash_area_erased_val()``

    * stream_flash: Eliminated the usage of the flash API internals.


  * File Systems

    * Enabled FCB to work with non-0xff erase value flash.
